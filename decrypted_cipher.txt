b'b\'\\xc4\\x8f\\xc2\\xbb\\xc5\\xbcIF   you   happen  to  have  read  another  book  about\\nChristopher Robin, you may remember that he once had a swan (or\\nthe swan had Christopher Robin, I don\\\'t know which) and that he\\nused to call this swan Pooh. That was a long time ago, and when\\nwe said good-bye, we took the name with us, as we didn\\\'t  think\\nthe  swan  would  want it any more. Well, when Edward Bear said\\nthat he would like an exciting name all to himself, Christopher\\nRobin said at once, without stopping  to  think,  that  he  was\\nWinnie-the-Pooh.  And  he was. So, as I have explained the Pooh\\npart, I will now explain the rest of it.\\nYou can\\\'t be in London for long without  going  to  the\\nZoo.  There are some people who begin the Zoo at the beginning,\\ncalled WAYIN, and walk as quickly as they can past  every  cage\\nuntil  they get to the one called WAYOUT, but the nicest people\\ngo straight to the animal they love the most, and  stay  there.\\nSo when Christopher Robin goes to the Zoo, he goes to where the\\nPolar  Bears are, and he whispers something to the third keeper\\nfrom the left, and doors are unlocked, and  we  wander  through\\ndark passages and up steep stairs, until at last we come to the\\nspecial  cage,  and the cage is opened, and out trots something\\nbrown  and  furry,  and  with  a  happy  cry  of  "Oh,   Bear!"\\nChristopher Robin rushes into its arms. Now this bear\\\'s name is\\nWinnie,  which  shows what a good name for bears it is, but the\\nfunny thing is that we can\\\'t remember whether Winnie is  called\\nafter Pooh, or Pooh after Winnie. We did know once, but we have\\nforgotten. . . .\\n\\n        I  had written as far as this when Piglet looked up and\\nsaid in his squeaky voice, "What about Me?" "My dear Piglet," I\\nsaid, "the whole book is about you." "So it is about Pooh,"  he\\nsqueaked.  You  see what it is. He is jealous because he thinks\\nPooh is having a Grand Introduction all to himself. Pooh is the\\nfavourite, of course, there\\\'s no denying it, but  Piglet  comes\\nin  for a good many things which Pooh misses; because you can\\\'t\\ntake Pooh to school without everybody knowing it, but Piglet is\\nso small that  he  slips  into  a  pocket,  where  it  is  very\\ncomforting  to  feel  him  when  you are not quite sure whether\\ntwice seven is twelve or twenty-two. Sometimes he slips out and\\nhas a good look in the ink-pot, and in this way he has got more\\neducation than Pooh, but Pooh doesn\\\'t mind. Some  have  brains,\\nand some haven\\\'t, he says, and there it is.\\n\\n        And  now all the others are saying, "What about Us?" So\\nperhaps the best thing to do is to stop  writing  Introductions\\nand get on with the book.\\nHERE is Edward Bear, coming downstairs now, bump, bump,\\nbump, on the back of his head, behind Christopher Robin. It is,\\nas far as  he  knows,  the  only  way of coming downstairs, but\\nsometimes he feels that there really is another way, if only he\\ncould stop bumping for a moment and think of it.\\n\\n        And then he feels that  perhaps  there  isn\\\'t.  Anyhow,\\nhere  he  is  at the bottom, and ready to be introduced to you.\\nWinnie-the-Pooh.\\n When I first heard his name, I said, just  as  you  are\\ngoing to say, "But I thought he was a boy?"\\n\\n        "So did I," said Christopher Robin.\\n\\n        "Then you can\\\'t call him Winnie?"\\n\\n        "I don\\\'t."\\n\\n        "But you said -- "\\n\\n        "He\\\'s  Winnie-ther-Pooh.  Don\\\'t  you  know  what \\\'ther\\\'\\nmeans?"\\n\\n        "Ah, yes, now I do," I said quickly; and I hope you  do\\ntoo, because it is all the explanation you are going to get.\\n\\n        Sometimes  Winnie-the-Pooh  likes  a  game of some sort\\nwhen he comes downstairs, and sometimes he likes to sit quietly\\nin front of the fire and listen to a story. This evening --\\n\\n        "What about a story?" said Christopher Robin.\\n\\n        "What about a story?" I said.\\n\\n        "Could you very sweetly tell Winnie-the-Pooh one?"\\n\\n        "I suppose I could," I said. "What sort of stories does\\nhe like?"\\n\\n        "About himself. Because he\\\'s that sort of Bear."\\n\\n        "Oh, I see."\\n\\n        "So could you very sweetly?"\\n\\n        "I\\\'ll try," I said.\\n\\n        So I tried.\\n\\n\\n        Once upon a time, a very long time ago now, about  last\\nFriday,  Winnie-the-Pooh lived in a forest all by himself under\\nthe name of Sanders.\\n\\n        ("What does \\\'under the name\\\' mean?"  asked  Christopher\\nRobin. "It means he had the name over the door in gold letters,\\nand lived under it."\\n\\n        "Winnie-the-Pooh  wasn\\\'t  quite sure," said Christopher\\nRobin.\\n\\n        "Now I am," said a growly voice.\\n\\n        "Then I will go on," said I.)\\n\\n\\n        One day when he was out walking, he  came  to  an  open\\nplace  in  the  middle of the forest, and in the middle of this\\nplace was a large oak-tree, and, from  the  top  of  the  tree,\\nthere came a loud buzzing-noise.\\n\\n        Winnie-the-Pooh  sat  down at the foot of the tree, put\\nhis head between his paws and began to think.\\n\\n        First of all he said to  himself:  "That  buzzing-noise\\nmeans  something. You don\\\'t get a buzzing-noise like that, just\\nbuzzing and buzzing, without its meaning something. If  there\\\'s\\na  buzzing-noise,  somebody\\\'s  making  a buzzing-noise, and the\\nonly reason for making  a  buzzing-noise  that  I  know  of  is\\nbecause you\\\'re a bee."\\n\\n        Then  he  thought another long time, and said: "And the\\nonly reason for being a bee that I know of is making honey."\\n\\n        And then he got up, and said: "And the only reason  for\\nmaking  honey  is so as I can eat it." So he began to climb the\\ntree\\n\\n        He climbed and he climbed and  he  climbed  and  as  he\\nclimbed he sang a little song to himself. It went like this:\\n\\n        \\n        Isn\\\'t it funny\\n        How a bear likes honey?\\n        Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!\\n        I wonder why he does?\\n        \\n\\n        Then he climbed a little further.  .  .  and  a  little\\nfurther  .  . . and then just a little further. By that time he\\nhad thought of another song.\\n\\n\\n        \\n        It\\\'s a very funny thought that, if Bears were Bees,\\n        They\\\'d build their nests at the bottom of trees.\\n        And that being so (if the Bees were Bears),\\n        We shouldn\\\'t have to climb up all these stairs.\\n        \\n\\n\\n        He was getting rather tired by this time,  so  that  is\\nwhy he sang a Complaining Song. He was nearly there now, and if\\nhe just s t o o d o n t h a t branch . . .\\n\\n        Crack !\\n\\n        "Oh,  help!"  said  Pooh, as he dropped ten feet on the\\nbranch below him.\\n\\n        "If only I hadn\\\'t -- " he said, as  he  bounced  twenty\\nfeet on to the next branch.\\n\\n        "You  see,  what  I  meant  to do," he explained, as he\\nturned head-over-heels, and crashed on to another branch thirty\\nfeet below, "what I meant to do -- "\\n\\n        "Of course, it was rather  --  "  he  admitted,  as  he\\nslithered very quickly through the next six branches.\\n\\n        "It  all  comes,  I  suppose,"  he  decided, as he said\\ngood-bye to the last branch, spun round three times,  and  flew\\ngracefully  into a gorse-bush, "it all comes of liking honey so\\nmuch. Oh, help!"\\n\\n        He crawled out of the gorse-bush, brushed the  prickles\\nfrom  his  nose, and began to think again. And the first person\\nhe thought of was Christopher Robin.\\n\\n        ("Was that me?"  said  Christopher  Robin  in  an  awed\\nvoice, hardly daring to believe it.\\n\\n        "That was you."\\n\\n        Christopher Robin said nothing, but his eyes got larger\\nand larger, and his face got pinker and pinker.)\\n\\n        So Winnie-the-Pooh went round to his friend Christopher\\nRobin, who  lived  behind  a  green door in another part of the\\nForest.\\n\\n        "Good morning, Christopher Robin," he said.\\n\\n        "Good morning, Winnie-ther-Pooh," said you.\\n\\n        "I wonder if you\\\'ve got such a thing as a balloon about\\nyou?"\\n\\n        "A balloon?"\\n\\n        "Yes, I just said to myself coming along: \\\'I wonder  if\\nChristopher  Robin  has such a thing as a balloon about him?\\\' I\\njust said it to myself, thinking of balloons, and wondering."\\n\\n        "What do you want a balloon for?" you said.\\n\\n        Winnie-the-Pooh looked round to  see  that  nobody  was\\nlistening,  put  his  paw  to  his  mouth,  and  said in a deep\\nwhisper: "Honey!"\\n\\n        "But you don\\\'t get honey with balloons!"\\n\\n        "I do," said Pooh.\\n\\n        Well, it just happened that you had been to a party the\\nday before at the house of your  friend  Piglet,  and  you  had\\nballoons at the party. You had had a big green balloon; and one\\nof  Rabbit\\\'s  relations had had a big blue one, and had left it\\nbehind, being really too young to go to a party at all; and  so\\nyou had brought the green one and the blue one home with you.\\n\\n        "Which  one would you like?" you asked Pooh. He put his\\nhead between his paws and thought very carefully.\\n\\n        "It\\\'s like this," he said. "When  you  go  after  honey\\nwith  a  balloon,  the  great thing is not to let the bees know\\nyou\\\'re coming. Now, if you have a  green  balloon,  they  might\\nthink  you  were only part of the tree, and not notice you, and\\nif you have a blue balloon, they might think you were only part\\nof the sky, and not notice you, and the question is:  Which  is\\nmost likely?"\\n\\n        "Wouldn\\\'t  they notice you underneath the balloon?" you\\nasked.\\n\\n        "They might or they might not,"  said  Winnie-the-Pooh.\\n"You  never  can  tell  with bees." He thought for a moment and\\nsaid: "I shall try to look like a small black cloud. That  will\\ndeceive them."\\n\\n        "Then  you had better have the blue balloon," you said;\\nand so it was decided.\\n\\n        Well, you both went out with the blue balloon, and  you\\ntook  your  gun  with you, just in case, as you always did, and\\nWinnie-the-Pooh went to a very muddy place that he knew of, and\\nrolled and rolled until he was black all over; and  then,  when\\nthe  balloon  was blown up as big as big, and you and Pooh were\\nboth holding on to the string, you let go  suddenly,  and  Pooh\\nBear  floated  gracefully  up into the sky, and stayed there --\\nlevel with the top of the tree and about twenty feet away  from\\nit.\\n\\n        "Hooray!" you shouted.\\n\\n        "Isn\\\'t that fine?" shouted Winnie-the-Pooh down to you.\\n"What do I look like?"\\n\\n        "You  look  like  a  Bear holding on to a balloon," you\\nsaid.\\n\\n        "Not," said Pooh anxiously, " -- not like a small black\\ncloud in a blue sky?"\\n\\n        "Not very much."\\n\\n        "Ah, well, perhaps from up  here  it  looks  different.\\nAnd, as I say, you never can tell with bees."\\n\\n        There  was  no  wind to blow him nearer to the tree, so\\nthere he stayed. He could see the honey,  he  could  smell  the\\nhoney, but he couldn\\\'t quite reach the honey.\\n\\n        After a little while he called down to you.\\n\\n        "Christopher Robin!" he said in a loud whisper.\\n\\n        "Hallo!"\\n\\n        "I think the bees suspect something!"\\n\\n        "What sort of thing?"\\n\\n        "I  don\\\'t  know.  But  something  tells me that they\\\'re\\nsuspicious!"\\n\\n        "Perhaps they think that you\\\'re after their honey?"\\n\\n        "It may be that. You never can tell with bees."\\n\\n        There was another little silence, and  then  he  called\\ndown to you again.\\n\\n        "Christopher Robin!"\\n\\n        "Yes?"\\n\\n        "Have you an umbrella in your house?"\\n\\n        "I think so."\\n\\n        "I  wish  you  would bring it out here, and walk up and\\ndown with it, and look up at me every now  and  then,  and  say\\n\\\'Tut-tut,  it  looks  like  rain.\\\' I think, if you did that, it\\nwould help the deception  which  we  are  practising  on  these\\nbees."\\n\\n        Well,  you  laughed to yourself, "Silly old Bear !" but\\nyou didn\\\'t say it aloud because you were so fond  of  him,  and\\nyou went home for your umbrella.\\n\\n        "Oh,  there  you  are!" called down Winnie-the-Pooh, as\\nsoon as you got back to the  tree.  "I  was  beginning  to  get\\nanxious.  I  have  discovered  that the bees are now definitely\\nSuspicious."\\n\\n        "Shall I put my umbrella up?" you said.\\n\\n        "Yes,  but  wait  a  moment.  We must be practical. The\\nimportant bee to deceive is the Queen Bee. Can you see which is\\nthe Queen Bee from down there?"\\n\\n        "No."\\n\\n        "A pity. Well, now, if you walk up and down  with  your\\numbrella,  saying,  \\\'Tut-tut,  it  looks like rain,\\\' I shall do\\nwhat I can by singing a little Cloud  Song,  such  as  a  cloud\\nmight sing. . . . Go!"\\n\\n        So,  while  you  walked  up and down and wondered if it\\nwould rain, Winnie-the-Pooh sang this song:\\n\\n        \\n        How sweet to be a Cloud\\n        Floating in the Blue!\\n        Every little cloud\\n        Always sings aloud.\\n        "How sweet to be a Cloud\\n        Floating in the Blue!"\\n        It makes him very proud\\n        To be a little cloud.\\n        \\n\\n        The bees were still buzzing as  suspiciously  as  ever.\\nSome  of  them, indeed, left their nests and flew all round the\\ncloud as it began the second verse of this song,  and  one  bee\\nsat down on the nose of the cloud for a moment, and then got up\\nagain.\\n\\n        "Christopher -- ow! -- Robin," called out the cloud.\\n\\n        "Yes?"\\n\\n        "I  have  just been thinking, and I have come to a very\\nimportant decision. These are the wrong sort of bees."\\n\\n        "Are they?"\\n\\n        "Quite the wrong sort. So I  should  think  they  would\\nmake the wrong sort of honey, shouldn\\\'t you?"\\n\\n        "Would they?"\\n\\n        "Yes. So I think I shall come down."\\n\\n        "How?" asked you.\\n\\n        Winnie-the-Pooh hadn\\\'t thought about this. If he let go\\nof the string,  he would fall -- bump -- and he didn\\\'t like the\\nidea of that. So he thought for a long time, and then he said:\\n\\n        "Christopher Robin, you must  shoot  the  balloon  with\\nyour gun. Have you got your gun?"\\n\\n        "Of  course  I  have,"  you said. "But if I do that, it\\nwill spoil the balloon," you said. But if you don\\\'t" said Pooh,\\n"I shall have to let go, and that would spoil me."\\n\\n        When he put it like this, you saw how it was,  and  you\\naimed very carefully at the balloon, and fired.\\n\\n        "Ow!" said Pooh.\\n\\n        "Did I miss?" you asked.\\n\\n        "You  didn\\\'t  exactly miss," said Pooh, "but you missed\\nthe balloon."\\n\\n        "I\\\'m so sorry," you said, and you fired again, and this\\ntime you hit the balloon and  the  air  came  slowly  out,  and\\nWinnie-the-Pooh floated down to the ground.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        But  his  arms  were  so  stiff  from holding on to the\\nstring of the  balloon  all  that  time  that  they  stayed  up\\nstraight  in  the  air for more than a week, and whenever a fly\\ncame and settled on his nose he had to blow it off. And I think\\n-- but I am not sure -- that that is why he was  always  called\\nPooh.\\n\\n\\n\\n        "Is  that  the  end  of  the  story?" asked Christopher\\nRobin.\\n\\n        "That\\\'s the end of that one. There are others."\\n\\n        "About Pooh and Me?"\\n\\n        "And Piglet and  Rabbit  and  all  of  you.  Don\\\'t  you\\nremember?"\\n\\n        "I  do  remember,  and  then  when I try to remember, I\\nforget."\\n\\n        "That day when Pooh  and  Piglet  tried  to  catch  the\\nHeffalump -- "\\n\\n        "They didn\\\'t catch it, did they?"\\n\\n        "No."\\n\\n        "Pooh  couldn\\\'t,  because  he  hasn\\\'t  any brain. Did I\\ncatch it?"\\n\\n        "Well, that comes into the story."\\n\\n        Christopher Robin nodded.\\n\\n        "I do remember," he said, "only Pooh doesn\\\'t very well,\\nso that\\\'s why he likes having it told  to  him  again.  Because\\nthen it\\\'s a real story and not just a remembering."\\n\\n        "That\\\'s just how I feel," I said.\\n\\n        Christopher  Robin gave a deep sigh, picked his Bear up\\nby the leg, and walked off to the door,  trailing  Pooh  behind\\nhim.  At the door he turned and said, "Coming to see me have my\\nbath?" "I didn\\\'t hurt him when I shot him, did I?" "Not a bit."\\nHe nodded and went out, and in a moment I heard Winnie-the-Pooh\\n-- bump, bump, bump -- going up the stairs behind him.\\n EDWARD BEAR, known to his friends  as  Winnie-the-Pooh,\\nor  Pooh  for  short,  was  walking through the forest one day,\\nhumming proudly to himself. He had made up a  little  hum  that\\nvery  morning, as he was doing his Stoutness Exercises in front\\nof the glass: Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, as he stretched up as  high\\nas  he could go, and then Tra-la-la, tra-la -- oh, help! -- la,\\nas he tried to reach his toes. After breakfast he had  said  it\\nover  and  over to himself until he had learnt it off by heart,\\nand now he was humming it right through, properly. It went like\\nthis:\\n\\n\\n        \\n        Tra-la-la, tra-la-la,\\n        Tra-la-la, tra-la-la,\\n        Rum-tum-tiddle-um-tum.\\n        Tiddle-iddle, tiddle-iddle,\\n        Tiddle-iddle, tiddle-iddle,\\n        Rum-tum-tum-tiddle-um.\\n        \\n\\n        Well, he was humming this hum to himself,  and  walking\\nalong  gaily, wondering what everybody else was doing, and what\\nit felt like, being somebody else, when suddenly he came  to  a\\nsandy bank, and in the bank was a large hole.\\n\\n        "Aha  !" said Pooh. (Rum-tum-tiddle-um-tum.) "If I know\\nanything about anything, that hole means Rabbit," he said, "and\\nRabbit means Company," he said, "and  Company  means  Food  and\\nListening-to-Me-Humming and such like. Rum-tum-tum-tiddle-um.\\n\\n        So he bent down, put his head into the hole, and called\\nout:\\n\\n        "Is anybody at home?"\\n\\n        There  was  a  sudden  scuffling  noise from inside the\\nhole, and then silence.\\n\\n        "What I said was, \\\'Is anybody  at  home?\\\'"  called  out\\nPooh very loudly.\\n\\n        "No!"  said a voice; and then added, "You needn\\\'t shout\\nso loud. I heard you quite well the first time."\\n\\n        "Bother!" said Pooh. "Isn\\\'t there anybody here at all?"\\n\\n        "Nobody."\\n\\n        Winnie-the-Pooh took his head  out  of  the  hole,  and\\nthought for a little, and he thought to himself, "There must be\\nsomebody  there,  because somebody must have said \\\'Nobody.\\\'" So\\nhe put his head back in the hole,  and  said:  "Hallo,  Rabbit,\\nisn\\\'t that you?"\\n\\n        "No,"  said  Rabbit,  in a different sort of voice this\\ntime.\\n\\n        "But isn\\\'t that Rabbit\\\'s voice?"\\n\\n        "I don\\\'t think so," said Rabbit.  "It  isn\\\'t  meant  to\\nbe."\\n\\n        "Oh!" said Pooh.\\n    He  took  his  head  out  of  the hole, and had another\\nthink, and then he put it back, and said:\\n\\n        "Well, could you very kindly tell me where Rabbit is?"\\n\\n        "He has gone to see his friend  Pooh  Bear,  who  is  a\\ngreat friend of his."\\n\\n        "But this is Me!" said Bear, very much surprised.\\n\\n        "What sort of Me?"\\n\\n        "Pooh Bear."\\n\\n        "Are you sure?" said Rabbit, still more surprised.\\n\\n        "Quite, quite sure," said Pooh.\\n\\n        "Oh, well, then, come in."\\n\\n        So  Pooh  pushed  and pushed and pushed his way through\\nthe hole, and at last he got in.\\n\\n        "You were quite right," said Rabbit, looking at him all\\nover. "It is you. Glad to see you."\\n\\n        "Who did you think it was?"\\n\\n        "Well, I wasn\\\'t sure. You know how it is in the Forest.\\nOne can\\\'t have anybody coming into one\\\'s house. One has  to  be\\ncareful. What about a mouthful of something?"\\n\\n        Pooh  always liked a little something at eleven o\\\'clock\\nin the morning, and he was very glad to see Rabbit getting  out\\nthe  plates and mugs; and when Rabbit said, "Honey or condensed\\nmilk with your bread?" he was so excited that he said,  "Both,"\\nand then, so as not to seem greedy, he added, "But don\\\'t bother\\nabout  the  bread,  please."  And for a long time after that he\\nsaid nothing . . . until at  last,  humming  to  himself  in  a\\nrather  sticky  voice,  he got up, shook Rabbit lovingly by the\\npaw, and said that he must be going on.\\n\\n        "Must you?" said Rabbit politely\\n\\n        "Well," said Pooh, "I could stay a little longer if  it\\n-- if  you -- " and he tried very hard to look in the direction\\nof the larder.\\n\\n        "As a matter of fact," said Rabbit, "I  was  going  out\\nmyself directly."\\n\\n        "Oh well, then, I\\\'ll be going on. Good-bye."\\n\\n        "Well,  good-bye,  if  you\\\'re  sure  you won\\\'t have any\\nmore."\\n\\n        "Is there any more?" asked Pooh quickly.\\n\\n        Rabbit took the covers off the dishes, and  said,  "No,\\nthere wasn\\\'t."\\n\\n        "I  thought  not," said Pooh, nodding to himself "Well,\\ngood-bye. I must be going on."\\n\\n        So he started to climb out of the hole. He pulled  with\\nhis  front paws, and pushed with his back paws, and in a little\\nwhile his nose was out in the open again . .  .  and  then  his\\nears . . . and then his front paws . . . and then his shoulders\\n. . . and then --\\n\\n        "Oh, help!" said Pooh. "I\\\'d better go back."\\n\\n        "Oh, bother!" said Pooh. "I shall have to go on."\\n\\n        "I can\\\'t do either!" said Pooh. "Oh, help and bother!"\\n\\n        Now,  by  this time Rabbit wanted to go for a walk too,\\nand finding the front door full, he went out by the back  door,\\nand came round to Pooh, and looked at him.\\n\\n        "Hallo, are you stuck?" he asked.\\n\\n        "N-no,"   said   Pooh  carelessly.  "Just  resting  and\\nthinking and humming to myself."\\n\\n        "Here, give us a paw."\\n\\n        Pooh Bear stretched out a paw, and  Rabbit  pulled  and\\npulled and pulled....\\n\\n        "0w!" cried Pooh. "You\\\'re hurting!"\\n\\n        "The fact is," said Rabbit, "you\\\'re stuck."\\n\\n        "It all comes," said Pooh crossly, "of not having front\\ndoors big enough."\\n\\n        "It  all  comes,"  said  Rabbit sternly, "of eating too\\nmuch. I thought at the time," said Rabbit, "only I didn\\\'t  like\\nto  say  anything," said Rabbit, "that one of us has eating too\\nmuch," said Rabbit, "and I knew it wasn\\\'t me," he said.  "Well,\\nwell, I shall go and fetch Christopher Robin."\\n\\n        Christopher Robin lived at the other end of the Forest,\\nand when  he  came  back with Rabbit, and saw the front half of\\nPooh, he said, "Silly old Bear," in such a  loving  voice  that\\neverybody felt quite hopeful again.\\n\\n        "I  was  just  beginning to think," said Bear, sniffing\\nslightly, "that Rabbit might never be able  to  use  his  front\\ndoor again. And I should hate that," he said.\\n\\n        "So should I," said Rabbit.\\n\\n        "Use his front door again?" said Christopher Robin. "Of\\ncourse he\\\'ll use his front door again. "Good," said Rabbit.\\n\\n        "If  we  can\\\'t  pull  you  out, Pooh, we might push you\\nback."\\n\\n        Rabbit scratched his whiskers thoughtfully, and pointed\\nout that, when once Pooh was pushed back, he was back,  and  of\\ncourse  nobody  was  more  glad  to see Pooh than he was, still\\nthere it was, some lived in trees and some  lived  underground,\\nand --\\n\\n        "You mean I\\\'d never get out?" said Pooh.\\n\\n        "I  mean,"  said  Rabbit,  "that  having got so far, it\\nseems a pity to waste it."\\n\\n        Christopher Robin nodded.\\n\\n        "Then there\\\'s only one thing to be done," he said.  "We\\nshall have to wait for you to get thin again."\\n\\n        "How   long   does   getting  thin  take?"  asked  Pooh\\nanxiously.\\n\\n        "About a week, I should think."\\n\\n        "But I can\\\'t stay here for a week!"\\n\\n        "You can stay here all  right,  silly  old  Bear.  It\\\'s\\ngetting you out which is so difficult."\\n\\n        "We\\\'ll  read  to  you,"  said Rabbit cheerfully. "And I\\nhope it won\\\'t snow," he added. "And I say, old  fellow,  you\\\'re\\ntaking  up  a good deal of room in my house -- do you mind if I\\nuse your back legs as a towel-horse?  Because,  I  mean,  there\\nthey  are  --  doing nothing -- and it would be very convenient\\njust to hang the towels on them."\\n\\n        "A week!" said Pooh gloomily. "What about meals?"\\n\\n        "I\\\'m afraid no meals," said Christopher Robin, "because\\nof getting thin quicker. But we will read to you."\\n\\n        Bear began to sigh, and then found he couldn\\\'t  because\\nhe  was so tightly stuck; and a tear rolled down his eye, as he\\nsaid:\\n\\n        "Then would you read a Sustaining Book, such  as  would\\nhelp  and  comfort  a Wedged Bear in Great Tightness?" So for a\\nweek Christopher\\n\\n        Robin read that sort of book at the North end of  Pooh,\\nand  Rabbit  hung  his  washing  on  the South end . . . and in\\nbetween Bear felt himself getting slenderer and slenderer.  And\\nat the end of the week Christopher Robin said, "Now!"\\n\\n        So  he  took  hold of Pooh\\\'s front paws and Rabbit took\\nhold  of  Christopher  Robin,  and  all  Rabbit\\\'s  friends  and\\nrelations took hold of Rabbit, and they all pulled together....\\n\\n        And for a long time Pooh only said "Ow!" . . .\\n\\n        And "Oh!" . . .\\n\\n        And  then, all of a sudden, he said "Pop!" just as if a\\ncork were coming out of bottle.\\n\\n        And Christopher  Robin  and  Rabbit  and  all  Rabbit\\\'s\\nfriends  and relations went head-over-heels backwards . . . and\\non the top of them came Winnie-the-Pooh -- free!\\n\\n        So, with a nod of thanks to his  friends,  he  went  on\\nwith  his  walk through the forest, humming proudly to himself.\\nBut, Christopher Robin looked after him lovingly, and  said  to\\nhimself, "Silly old Bear!"\\nTHE Piglet lived in a very grand house in the middle of\\na beech-tree,  and  the  beech-tree  was  in  the middle of the\\nforest, and the Piglet lived in the middle of the  house.  Next\\nto   his   house  was  a  piece  of  broken  board  which  had:\\n"TRESPASSERS W" on it. When Christopher Robin asked the  Piglet\\nwhat  it  meant, he said it was his grandfather\\\'s name, and had\\nbeen in the family for a long time. Christopher Robin said  you\\ncouldn\\\'t  be  called  Trespassers  W,  and Piglet said yes, you\\ncould, because his  grandfather  was,  and  it  was  short  for\\nTrespassers  Will, which was short for Trespassers William. And\\nhis grandfather had had two  names  in  case  he  lost  one  --\\nTrespassers after an uncle, and William after Trespassers.\\n\\n        "I\\\'ve   got   two   names,"   said   Christopher  Robin\\ncarelessly.\\n\\n        "Well, there you are, that proves it," said Piglet.\\n\\n        One fine winter\\\'s day when Piglet was brushing away the\\nsnow in front of his house, he happened to look up,  and  there\\nwas  Winnie-the-Pooh.  Pooh  was  walking  round and round in a\\ncircle, thinking of something else, and when Piglet  called  to\\nhim, he just went on walking.\\n"Hallo!" said Piglet, "what are you doing?"\\n\\n        "Hunting," said Pooh.\\n\\n        "Hunting what?"\\n\\n        "Tracking   something,"   said   Winnie-the-Pooh   very\\nmysteriously.\\n\\n        "Tracking what?" said Piglet, coming closer\\n\\n        "That\\\'s just what I ask myself. I ask myself, What?"\\n\\n        "What do you think you\\\'ll answer?"\\n\\n        "I shall have to wait until I catch up with  it,"  said\\nWinnie-the-Pooh. "Now, look there." He pointed to the ground in\\nfront of him. "What do you see there?"\\n\\n        "Tracks,"  said  Piglet.  "Paw-marks." He gave a little\\nsqueak of excitement. "Oh, Pooh! Do you think it\\\'s a -- a --  a\\nWoozle?"\\n\\n        "It may be," said Pooh. "Sometimes it is, and sometimes\\nit isn\\\'t. You never can tell with paw-marks."\\n\\n        With  these  few words he went on tracking, and Piglet,\\nafter watching  him  for  a  minute  or  two,  ran  after  him.\\nWinnie-the-Pooh had come to a sudden stop, and was bending over\\nthe tracks in a puzzled sort of way.\\n\\n        "What\\\'s the matter?" asked Piglet.\\n\\n        "It\\\'s  a  very funny thing," said Bear, "but there seem\\nto be two animals now. This  --  whatever-it-was  --  has  been\\njoined by another -- whatever-it-is --\\n\\n        and  the  two  of  them  are now proceeding in company.\\nWould you mind coming with me, Piglet, in case they turn out to\\nbe Hostile Animals?"\\n\\n        Piglet scratched his ear in a nice  sort  of  way,  and\\nsaid  that  he  had  nothing  to  do until Friday, and would be\\ndelighted to come, in case it really was a Woozle.\\n\\n        "You mean, in case it  really  is  two  Woozles,"  said\\nWinnie-the-Pooh,  and Piglet said that anyhow he had nothing to\\ndo until Friday. So off they went together.\\n\\n        There was a small spinney of larch trees just here, and\\nit seemed as if the two Woozles, if that is what they were, had\\nbeen going round this spinney; so round this spinney went  Pooh\\nand  Piglet after them; Piglet passing the time by telling Pooh\\nwhat his Grandfather Trespassers W had done to Remove Stiffness\\nafter Tracking, and  how  his  Grandfather  Trespassers  W  had\\nsuffered in his later years from Shortness of Breath, and other\\nmatters  of interest, and Pooh wondering what a Grandfather was\\nlike, and if perhaps this was Two Grandfathers they were  after\\nnow,  and,  if so, whether he would be allowed to take one home\\nand keep it, and what Christopher Robin would  say.  And  still\\nthe tracks went on in front of them....\\n\\n        Suddenly Winnie-the-Pooh stopped, and pointed excitedly\\nin front of him. "Look!"\\n\\n        "What?"  said  Piglet,  with  a jump. And then, to show\\nthat he hadn\\\'t been frightened, he jumped up and down  once  or\\ntwice more in an exercising sort of way.\\n\\n        "The tracks!" said Pooh. "A third animal has joined the\\nother two!"  "Pooh!"  cried  Piglet "Do you think it is another\\nWoozle?"\\n\\n        "No," said Pooh, "because it makes different marks.  It\\nis  either Two Woozles and one, as it might be, Wizzle, or Two,\\nas it might be, Wizzles and one, if so it is,  Woozle.  Let  us\\ncontinue to follow them."\\n\\n        So  they went on, feeling just a little anxious now, in\\ncase the three animals in front of them were of Hostile Intent.\\nAnd Piglet wished very much that his  Grandfather  T.  W.  were\\nthere, instead of elsewhere, and Pooh thought how nice it would\\nbe   if   they   met   Christopher  Robin  suddenly  but  quite\\naccidentally, and only because he liked  Christopher  Robin  so\\nmuch. And then, all of a sudden, Winnie-the-Pooh stopped again,\\nand  licked the tip of his nose in a cooling manner, for he was\\nfeeling more hot and anxious than  ever  in  his  life  before.\\nThere were four animals in front of them!\\n\\n        "Do you see, Piglet? Look at their tracks! Three, as it\\nwere, Woozles,  and  one, as it was, Wizzle. Another Woozle has\\njoined them!"\\n\\n        And so it seemed to be. There were the tracks; crossing\\nover each other here, getting muddled up with each other there;\\nbut, quite plainly every now and then, the tracks of four  sets\\nof paws.\\n\\n        "I  think,"  said Piglet, when he had licked the tip of\\nhis nose too, and found that it brought very little comfort, "I\\nthink that I  have  just  remembered  something.  I  have  just\\nremembered  something that I forgot to do yesterday and sha\\\'n\\\'t\\nbe able to do to-morrow. So I suppose I really ought to go back\\nand do it now."\\n\\n        "We\\\'ll do it this afternoon, and I\\\'ll come  with  you,"\\nsaid Pooh.\\n\\n        "It  isn\\\'t  the  sort  of  thing  you  can  do  in  the\\nafternoon,"  said  Piglet  quickly.  "It\\\'s  a  very  particular\\nmorning  thing,  that  has  to  be done in the morning, and, if\\npossible, between the hours of What  would  you  say  the  time\\nwas?"\\n\\n        "About  twelve,"  said  Winnie-the-Pooh, looking at the\\nsun.\\n\\n        "Between, as I was saying,  the  hours  of  twelve  and\\ntwelve  five. So, really, dear old Pooh, if you\\\'ll excuse me --\\nWhat\\\'s that."\\n\\n        Pooh looked up at the sky, and then, as  he  heard  the\\nwhistle  again,  he  looked  up  into  the  branches  of  a big\\noak-tree, and then he saw a friend of his.\\n\\n        "It\\\'s Christopher Robin," he said.\\n\\n        "Ah, then you\\\'ll be all right," said Piglet.\\n\\n        "You\\\'ll be quite  safe  with  him.  Good-bye,"  and  he\\ntrotted off home as quickly as he could, very glad to be Out of\\nAll Danger again.\\n\\n        Christopher Robin came slowly down his tree.\\n\\n        "Silly  old Bear," he said, "what were you doing? First\\nyou went round the spinney twice by yourself, and  then  Piglet\\nran  after  you and you went round again together, and then you\\nwere just going round a fourth time"\\n\\n        "Wait a moment," said Winnie-the-Pooh, holding  up  his\\npaw.\\n\\n        He  sat down and thought, in the most thoughtful way he\\ncould think. Then he fitted his paw into one of the Tracks  ...\\nand then he scratched his nose twice, and stood up.\\n\\n        "Yes," said Winnie-the-Pooh.\\n\\n        "I see now," said Winnie-the-Pooh.\\n\\n        "I have been Foolish and Deluded," said he, "and I am a\\nBear of No Brain at All."\\n\\n        "You\\\'re   the   Best  Bear  in  All  the  World,"  said\\nChristopher Robin soothingly.\\n\\n        "Am I?" said Pooh hopefully. And then he brightened  up\\nsuddenly.\\n\\n        "Anyhow," he said, "it is nearly Luncheon Time."\\n\\n        So he went home for it.\\nTHE  Old  Grey  Donkey,  Eeyore,  stood by himself in a\\nthistly corner of the forest, his front feet  well  apart,  his\\nhead  on  one  side,  and  thought  about  things. Sometimes he\\nthought sadly to himself,  "Why?"  and  sometimes  he  thought,\\n"Wherefore?"  and sometimes he thought, "Inasmuch as which?" --\\nand sometimes he didn\\\'t quite know what he was thinking  about.\\nSo  when  Winnie-the-Pooh  came stumping along, Eeyore was very\\nglad to be able to stop thinking for a little, in order to  say\\n"How do you do?" in a gloomy manner to him.\\n\\n        "And how are you?" said Winnie-the-Pooh.\\n\\n        Eeyore shook his head from side to side.\\n\\n        "Not  very how," he said. "I don\\\'t seem to have felt at\\nall how for a long time."\\n\\n        "Dear, dear," said Pooh, "I\\\'m sorry about  that.  Let\\\'s\\nhave a look at you." So Eeyore stood there, gazing sadly at the\\nground, and Winnie-the-Pooh walked all round him once.\\n\\n        "Why,  what\\\'s  happened  to  your  tail?"  he  said  in\\nsurprise.\\n\\n        "What has happened to it?" said Eeyore.\\n\\n        "It isn\\\'t there!"\\n\\n        "Are you sure?"\\n\\n        "Well, either a tail is there or  it  isn\\\'t  there  You\\ncan\\\'t make a mistake about it. And yours isn\\\'t there!"\\n\\n        "Then what is?"\\n\\n        "Nothing."\\n"Let\\\'s  have a look," said Eeyore, and he turned slowly\\nround to the place where his tail had been a little while  ago,\\nand then, finding that he couldn\\\'t catch it up, he turned round\\nthe other way, until he came back to where he was at first, and\\nthen  he  put  his head down and looked between his front legs,\\nand at last he said, with a long, sad sigh, "I  believe  you\\\'re\\nright"\\n\\n        "Of course I\\\'m right," said Pooh\\n\\n        "That  accounts for a Good Deal," said Eeyore gloomily.\\n"It explains Everything. No Wonder."\\n\\n        "You   must   have    left    it    somewhere,"    said\\nWinnie-the-Pooh.\\n\\n        "Somebody must have taken it," said Eeyore.\\n\\n        "How  Like  Them," he added, after a long silence. Pooh\\nfelt that he ought to  say  something  helpful  about  it,  but\\ndidn\\\'t quite know what.\\n\\n        So he decided to do something helpful instead.\\n\\n        "Eeyore,"  he  said solemnly, "I, Winnie-the-Pooh, will\\nfind your tail for you."\\n\\n        "Thank you, Pooh,"  answered  Eeyore.  "You\\\'re  a  real\\nfriend," said he. "Not like Some," he said.\\n\\n        So Winnie-the-Pooh went off to find Eeyore\\\'s tail.\\n\\n        It  was  a  fine  spring  morning  in  the forest as he\\nstarted out. Little soft clouds played happily in a  blue  sky,\\nskipping  from  time to time in front of the sun as if they had\\ncome to put it out, and then sliding away suddenly so that  the\\nnext might have his turn. Through them and between them the sun\\nshone bravely, and a copse which had worn its firs all the year\\nround  seemed old and dowdy now beside the new green lace which\\nthe beeches had put on so prettily. Through copse  and  spinney\\nmarched Bear; down open slopes of gorse and heather, over rocky\\nbeds  of  streams, up steep banks of sandstone into the heather\\nagain; and so at last, tired and hungry, to  the  Hundred  Acre\\nWood. For it was in the Hundred Acre Wood that Owl lived.\\n\\n        "And  if  anyone  knows  anything about anything," said\\nBear  to  himself,  "it\\\'s  Owl  who   knows   something   about\\nsomething,"  he  said,  "or  my name\\\'s not Winnie-the-Pooh," he\\nsaid. "Which it is," he added. "So there you are."\\n\\n        Owl lived at The Chestnuts, and old-world residence  of\\ngreat  charm,  which was grander than anybody else\\\'s, or seemed\\nso to Bear, because it had both  a  knocker  and  a  bell-pull.\\nUnderneath the knock'
